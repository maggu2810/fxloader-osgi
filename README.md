# JavaFX OSGi integration

The idea and initial code has been developed by "Tom Schindl" (see e.g. [Tomsondev Blog](https://tomsondev.bestsolution.at/)).

All thanks go to this person.

The code has been forked from the efxclipse-rt module [org.eclipse.fx.osgi 3.6.0](https://github.com/eclipse-efx/efxclipse-rt/tree/r.3.6.0/modules/core/org.eclipse.fx.osgi).
